1. On FF operations.
Add & Sub: compiled WASM, WASMSNARK, Native Rust have similar performance.
Mul: compiled WASM & WASMSNARK have similar performance. Both are 5ï½ž6x slower than Native Rust.

2. On EC operations
Add & Scalar Mul: WASMSNARK is 2x faster than compiled WASM. WASMSNARK is still 3.5x slower than Native Rust.

3. We have hardcoded tests for the correctness of both FF and EC operations.
